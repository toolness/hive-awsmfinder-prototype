This is a usability prototype for **AWSMfinder**.

AWSMfinder is a lightweight, youth facing platform that allows teens
to connect with interest-linked educational opportunities across
New York City, allows out-of-school educational organizations a
centralized place to promote their programs, and gives parents,
educators and mentors an up-to-date resource on learning opportunities
that they can point youth to.
